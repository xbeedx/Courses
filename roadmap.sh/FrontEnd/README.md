### What is HTTP?

HTTP is the ```TCP/IP``` based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. HTTP follows a classical “Client-Server model” with a client opening a connection request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

### DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
