##  CSS Selectors

Selectors are how you pick which element to apply styles to.
```css
p {
   margin-bottom: 12px;
}
```

Here, the "p" is the selector (selects all <p> elements) and applies the margin-bottom style.


## Type Selector

*A*.
Select elements by their type 
Selects all elements of type *A*. Type refers to the type of tag, so \<div>, \<p> and \<ul> are all different element types.

div selects all \<div> elements


## ID Selector

*#id*.
Select elements with an ID 
Selects the element with a specific id. You can also combine the ID selector with the type selector.

#cool selects any element with id="cool"


## Descendant Selector

*A*  *B*.
Select an element inside another element 
Selects all *B* inside of *A*. *B* is called a descendant because it is inside of another element.

*p  strong* selects all \<strong> elements that are inside of any \<p>

### Combine the Descendant & ID Selectors

*#id  A*
You can combine any selector with the descendent selector.

*#cool span* selects all \<span> elements that are inside of elements with id="cool"


## Class Selector

*.classname*.
Select elements by their class 
The class selector selects all elements with that class attribute. Elements can only have one ID, but many classes.

*.neato* selects all elements with class="neato"

### Combine the Class Selector
*A.className*
You can combine the class selector with other selectors, like the type selector.

ul.important selects all \<ul> elements that have class="important"


## Comma Combinator

*A, B*
Combine, selectors, with... commas!
Thanks to Shatner technology, this selects all *A* and *B* elements. You can combine any selectors this way, and you can specify more than two.

p, .fun selects all \<p> elements as well as all elements with class="fun"


## You can select everything!

*\**
You can select all elements with the universal selector!

p * selects any element inside all \<p> elements.

### Combine the Universal Selector

*A  \**
This selects all elements inside of A.

p * selects every element inside all \<p> elements.


## Adjacent Sibling Selector

*A + B*
Select an element that directly follows another element
This selects all *B* elements that directly follow *A*. Elements that follow one another are called siblings. They're on the same level, or depth.

In the HTML markup for this level, elements that have the same indentation are siblings.

p + .intro selects every element with class="intro" that directly follows a \<p>


## General Sibling Selector

*A ~ B*
Select elements that follows another element
You can select all siblings of an element that follow it. This is like the Adjacent Selector *(A + B)* except it gets all of the following elements instead of one.

A ~ B selects all *B* that follow a *A*


## Child Selector

*A > B*
Select direct children of an element
You can select elements that are direct children of other elements. A child element is any element that is nested directly in another element.

Elements that are nested deeper than that are called descendant elements.

A > B selects all *B* that are a direct children *A*


## First Child Pseudo-selector

*:first-child*
Select a first child element inside of another element
You can select the first child element. A child element is any element that is directly nested in another element. You can combine this pseudo-selector with other selectors.

:first-child selects all first child elements.


## Only Child Pseudo-selector

*:only-child*
Select an element that are the only element inside of another one.
You can select any element that is the only element inside of another one.

span:only-child selects the \<span> elements that are the only child of some other element.


## Last Child Pseudo-selector

*:last-child*
Select the last element inside of another element
You can use this selector to select an element that is the last child element inside of another element.

Pro Tip â†’ In cases where there is only one element, that element counts as the first-child, only-child and last-child!

:last-child selects all last-child elements.


## Nth Child Pseudo-selector

*:nth-child(A)*
Select an element by its order in another element
Selects the nth (Ex: 1st, 3rd, 12th etc.) child element in another element.

:nth-child(8) selects every element that is the 8th child of another element.


## Nth Last Child Selector

*:nth-last-child(A)*
Select an element by its order in another element, counting from the back
Selects the children from the bottom of the parent. This is like nth-child, but counting from the back!

:nth-last-child(2) selects all second-to-last child elements.


## First of Type Selector

*:first-of-type*
Select the first element of a specific type
Selects the first element of that type within another element.

span:first-of-type selects the first span in any element.


## Nth of Type Selector

*:nth-of-type(A)*
Selects a specific element based on its type and order in another element - or even or odd instances of that element.

div:nth-of-type(2) selects the second instance of a div.
.example:nth-of-type(odd) selects all odd instances of a the example class.


## Nth-of-type Selector with Formula

*:nth-of-type(An+B)*
The nth-of-type formula selects every nth element, starting the count at a specific instance of that element.

span:nth-of-type(6n+2) selects every 6th instance of a \<span>, starting from (and including) the second instance.


## Only of Type Selector

*:only-of-type*
Select elements that are the only ones of their type within of their parent element
Selects the only element of its type within another element.

p span:only-of-type selects a \<span> within any \<p> if it is the only \<span> in there.


## Last of Type Selector

*:last-of-type*
Select the last element of a specific type
Selects each last element of that type within another element. Remember type refers the kind of tag, so \<p> and \<span> are different types.

div:last-of-type selects the last \<div> in every element.


## Empty Selector

*:empty*
Select elements that don't have children
Selects elements that don't have any other elements inside of them.

div:empty selects all empty \<div> elements.


## Negation Pseudo-class

*:not(X)*
Select all elements that don't match the negation selector
You can use this to select all elements that do not match selector "X".

:not(#fancy) selects all elements that do not have id="fancy".


## Attribute Selector

*[attribute]*
Select all elements that have a specific attribute
Attributes appear inside the opening tag of an element, like this: \<span attribute="value">. An attribute does not always have a value, it can be blank!

a[href] selects all a elements that have a href="anything" attribute.


## Attribute Selector

*A[attribute]*
Select all elements that have a specific attribute
Combine the attribute selector with another selector (like the tag name selector) by adding it to the end.

[value] selects all elements that have a value="anything" attribute.


## Attribute Value Selector

*[attribute="value"]*
Select all elements that have a specific attribute value
Attribute selectors are case sensitive, each character must match exactly.

input[type="checkbox"] selects all checkbox input elements.


## Attribute Starts With Selector

*[attribute^="value"]*
Select all elements with an attribute value that starts with specific characters

.toy[category^="Swim"] selects elements with class toy and either category="Swimwear or category="Swimming".

### Attribute Ends With Selector

*[attribute$="value"]*
Select all elements with an attribute value that ends with specific characters

img[src$=".jpg"] selects all images display a .jpg image.

### Attribute Wildcard Selector

*[attribute*="value"]*
Select all elements with an attribute value that contains specific characters anywhere
A useful selector if you can identify a common pattern in things like class, href or src attributes.

img[src*="/thumbnails/"] selects all image elements that show images from the "thumbnails" folder.
