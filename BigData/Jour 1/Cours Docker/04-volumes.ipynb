    "\n",
    "- The data doesn’t persist when that container no longer exists, and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.\n",
    "- A container’s writable layer is tightly coupled to the host machine where the container is running. You can’t easily move the data somewhere else.\n",
    "- Writing into a container’s writable layer requires a [storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/) to manage the filesystem. The storage driver provides a union filesystem, using the Linux kernel. This extra abstraction reduces performance as compared to using *data volumes*, which write directly to the host filesystem.\n",

    "Created and managed by Docker. You can create a volume explicitly using the `docker volume create` command, or Docker can create a volume during container or service creation. This is the type of volume we used in this course.\n",
