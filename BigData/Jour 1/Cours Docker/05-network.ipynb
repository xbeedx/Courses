    "The default network driver. If you don’t specify a driver, this is the type of network you are creating. Bridge networks are usually used when your applications run in standalone containers that need to communicate. All containers without a `--network` specified, are attached to the default bridge network. On a user-defined bridge network, containers can resolve each other by name or alias.\n",
