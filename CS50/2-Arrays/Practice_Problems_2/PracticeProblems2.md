# Week 2 Practice Problems

In addition to this week’s lab and problem set, you’re welcome to try any of these (optional!) practice problems:

- [Hours](./hours/hours.md), for practice with arrays, passing arrays as parameters to a function, integer division and type casting
- [N0 V0w3ls](./no-vowels/no-vowels.md), for practice with strings, command-line arguments, and writing an entire program from scratch
- [Password](./password/password.md), for practice iterating through a string, using the ctype library, and using Boolean variables
