Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, Brazil was announced winner in 40% simulations.
But with more than that amount Belgium takes first place.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100000 simulations. Le result is always the same so we can consider it "good enough".
