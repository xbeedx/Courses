## Static to Dynamic
- Up until this point, all HTML you saw was pre-written and static.
- In the past, when you visited a page, the browser downloaded an HTML page, and you were able to view it.
- Dynamic pages refer to the ability of Python and similar languages to create HTML files on-the-fly. Accordingly, you can have web pages that are generated by options selected by your user.
- You have used http-server in the past to serve your web pages. Today, we are going to utilize a new server that can parse out a web address and perform actions based on the URL provided.

## Flask
- Flask is a third-party library that allows you to host web applications using the Flask framework within Python.
- You can run flask by executing flask run.
- To do so, you will need a file called app.py and a folder called templates.
- To get started, create a folder called templates and create a file called index.html with the following code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, width=device-width">
        <title>hello</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        hello, {{ name }}
    </body>
</html>
```
<sub>Notice the double {{ name }} that is a placeholder for something that will be later provided by our Flask server.<sub>
